# Project Scope Statement- Alesha's Personal Intro Webpage


## Project Name


NYC Explorer: A Travel Blog and Itinerary Guide


## Project Purpose


The purpose of this project is to create a simple, two-page website that serves as a helpful resource for people planning a trip to New York City. This website will showcase a curated itinerary, including sightseeing, halal- friendly food spots, and travel tips, in an easy-to-follow format.


## Description


NYC Explorer will be a beginner-friendly travel blog/itinerary site. It will feature two main pages:


* Home Page: An introduction to the website, overview of the trip, and highlights of the itinerary.


* Itinerary Page: A detailed, day-by-day plan covering attractions, food spots, and travel trips.


* The site will use basic HTML and CSS for structure and styling. Images and links will be included to make the itinerary practical and visually appealing.


## Desired Results * A functional two- page website prototype hosted on GitHub Pages.


* Clear and organized content that visitors can easily use to  plan a NYC trip.


* Demonstration of course concepts, including project planning, scoping, and version control in GitHub.


## Exclusions


* The website will not include a booking system or live travel updates.


* It will not feature advanced interactivity or dynamic content (JavaScript, databases, or real- time APIs)


* The scope does not include a mobile app or full branding package.


## Priorities


This HTML webpage needs to exceed my expectations and imagination. To get to this point, my priorities are:


* Clear, organized content for the itinerary (highest priority).


* Functional HTML structure and basic CSS styling for usability.


* Accessible and mobile- friendly layout.


* Professional presentation and documentation within the GitHub repository.


## Acceptance Criteria


* A complete 'scope.md' file with all required sections.


* A two- page HTML/CSS website prototype demonstrating the NYC travel blog/itinerary concept


* Content organized in a clear and readable format with headings, lists. and links.


* The entire project (proposal + prototype) housed in a single GitHub repository with proper file organization and README.
