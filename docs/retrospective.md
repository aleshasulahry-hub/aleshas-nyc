# Retrospective

## What Went Well?
The proposal- building process for Project 03 went well. First and foremost, the initial brainstorming and idea development was smooth. I used the frameworks from PMUPM to see what my risks were, and tried making an overall scope to make sure I made the website clearly and efficiently. 

## What Went Wrong
A few things went wrong, such as having a difficult time having the html links show up on my website. I had to delete several repositories because I wanted to start fresh and trace my steps carefully. 

## What I Would Do Differently
Next time, I would be more slow with creating my repository. I would also try looking for online tutorials for the steps I kept struggling on. Overall I would be more patient and enjoy the process of building.
