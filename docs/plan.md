# Risk Analysis

Risk Strategy:
There are two risks- Burn Out and Content Gaps. We will use the TAME method from PMUPM.
- Burn Out: There can be fatigue or loss of motivatoin dye to workload or time pressure. The strategy is mitigate. I can create a realistic task schedule with buffer days. Limit daily work sessions to avoid overload.
- Content Gaps: Difficuly finding quality information for itinerary or halal food spots. The strategy is transfer. Use trusted travel blogs or guides for curated content. Ask friends or community for recommendations.
TAME means: Transfer, Acccept, Mitigate, Eliminate.
